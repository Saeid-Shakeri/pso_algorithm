a## Particle Swarm Optimization üöÄ
<div align="justify">
<p>
The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is one of the well-known and practical metaheuristic algorithms. In metaheuristic terminology, an algorithm is considered to be one that uses a specific pattern of utilizing random events to optimize a value. In other words, these algorithms are often an attempt to model an optimization process in the real world.

Around 1995, Dr. Kennedy and Dr. Eberhart, during their joint research on a specific species of birds known as "barn swallows," noticed an interesting phenomenon. The group behavior of these particular birds exhibited a unique and natural pattern. It appeared that this specific species had the ability to share their information and achievements with each other in a group. This capability provided significant advantages for their survival. Inspired by this specific behavior, the classic PSO algorithm was conceived and later evolved, giving rise to various versions of it.

## About This Implementation üñ•Ô∏è
<div align="justify">
<p>
In this Python implementation, 12 particles are assumed to be located at pre-defined coordinates on the coordinate plane. The objective is to find the shortest distance to the center using the PSO algorithm. The movement of these particles at each stage is visualized using the matplotlib library to provide a better understanding of this algorithm, I have written explanations in the main code as comments to help you better understand the algorithm.
